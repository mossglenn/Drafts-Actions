> Designed for fast thought capture, not complex formatting.

## ‚ú® What This Action Does

**Flick-to-Jira** takes the current Draft and creates a new Jira issue using the first line as the **Summary** and the remaining text as the **Description**.

- üéüÔ∏è **First line** = Jira Summary (title)
- üìÑ **Remaining lines** = Jira Description (formatted in Atlassian Document Format [ADF])
- üè∑Ô∏è **Optional**: Draft tags can be automatically added as Jira labels
- üöÄ **Fast and frictionless**: No formatting required ‚Äî just type and send (bonus points for adding a ‚è©Ô∏è keyboard shortcut)
- üîí **Secure**: Uses Drafts‚Äô Credential system to store your Atlassian username and API token securely

---

- **Drafts app** (macOS or iOS)
- **Jira Cloud account**
- **Jira API Token** (üö´ not your password) ‚Äî [Get one here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

- Captures the first line of the Draft as the **Summary** (title).
- Converts remaining lines into a plain text  **Description**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember: Markdown may need ***two returns*** to encode a new line

- Adds optional labels:
  - **Draft tags**
  - **Customizable Jira labels**
- **Adds link to new Jira issue at the top of the Draft.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can adjust the Action‚Äôs behavior by editing the following **settings**:
| Setting | instructions |
|---|---|
| Issue Type | The name of any *Task-level* type of issue (also called Work Type) existing in the target Jira project (for example: `'Bug'` or `'Story'`). Custom types work as long as they are on the Task-level<p><p>\[Note: types like `'Epic'` and `'Subtask'` are *untested*\] |
| Include Tags as Labels | All tags on the current draft are included in the new Jira issue as labels. Draft tags are made Jira-safe with conversion to lowercase with no spaces (for example: 'My Tag' becomes 'my-tag'). <p><p>Even when this setting is deactivated, you can **still include labels** from the 'Jira Labels' setting. |
| Include Jira Labels | Add labels to the new Jira issue's labels. Labels are taken from the 'Jira Labels' setting. |
| Jira Labels | Any number of **Jira-safe** label texts, separated by commas, added to the new Jira issue's labels (example: 'sent-from-drafts, any-custom-label').<p>To not include these labels, deactivate the 'Include Jira Labels' setting. This setting does not interact with the 'Include Tags as Labels' setting. |

#### After Success Tag and Archive
This action does not automatically tag or arcive the current draft. Edit the Action to change the 'After Success' settings to configure these options. [Learn how](<https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/editing-actions>) 

#### Credential Name
Inside the script, you can configure the name of the Credential containing your email and token by changing the CREDENTIAL_NAME constant. The default name is *flick-to-Jira*. 
```javascript
// ===== USER SETTINGS =====
const CREDENTIAL_NAME = 'flick-to-jira'; //name of credential with email, and token
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Securing Secret Information

When communication with Jira Cloud, Flick-to-Jira collects:
- **Email** of Atlassian user
- **Token** of Atlassian user

This information is stored securely in Drafts Credentials. Once saved, you don't have to enter it again unless you manually forget the Credential.

#### Removing or Changing Credentials
Drafts does not let you view or edit saved Credentials directly. To update your Atlassian credentials:
1) Open Drafts Preferences > Credentials.
2) Look for the Credential named *flick-to-jira* (or your customized CREDENTIAL_NAME).
3) Click `forget` to delete it.

Drafts will ask you for new information the next time the Action runs.


## üß± Known Limitations

- Designed for **speed-first** capture ‚Äî not full Markdown parsing or complex formatting.
- Draft formatting (like bold, italics) is not translated into Jira formatting.
- If you switch Jira servers or projects, you must **manually forget saved credentials.**
